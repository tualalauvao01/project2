				<h3>Inspiration</h3>
				<p>This gadget was inspired by a sliding door. I thought about a sliding motion and how a small gadget like this could slide to reveal and hide the camera on someone's laptop.<p>

				<h3>The Meaning of 'Blockout'</h3>
				<p><strong>Blockout</strong> came from the term 'Blackout', essentially meaning to 'Blockout' the spies watching us through our laptop cameras.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>Devices</h3>
				<p>This gadget is to be made to fit onto all laptop brands, however, to do that it will have to be adjustable to fit any laptop. I have a windows microsoft surface laptop and a 2009 macbook pro so the dimensions and size of this gadget will be based off of these.</p>

				<h3>Functionality & Purpose</h3>
				<p>The function of this gadget is to block out the spies that watch us through our laptop cameras. I have seen plenty of university students who have sticky tape covering their cameras which led to this idea of having something to replace the sticky tape. The puropose is simple and has been mentioned- it is to block out those sneaky hacker spies who enjoy creepily watching you without your knowledge.</p>

				<h3>Why choose Blockout</h3>
				<p>Blockout is a handy gadget that will allow you to enjoy your privacy. Say goodbye to the sticky tape that you have to constantly replace when it has lost its stickiness and say hello to a gadget that will come to be useful for you. Blockout can help you fight the fear of spies, or the government, watching you. For you university students who are super sceptical about spies, this Blockout gadget is for you!</p>
