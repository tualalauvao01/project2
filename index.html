					<h3>How does it work?</h3>
					<p>The illustration above shows a sequence of the product sliding. All you have to do is slide it to hide and reveal your webcam once the gadget is sitting on top of your laptop.</p>

				<h3>Why choose Blockout</h3>
       	<p>Blockout is a handy gadget that will allow you to enjoy your privacy. Say goodbye to the sticky tape that you have to constantly replace when it has lost its stickiness and say hello to a gadget that will come to be useful for you. Blockout can help you fight the fear of spies, or the government, watching you. For you university students who are super sceptical about spies, this Blockout gadget is for you!</p>
    <p>Have you heard of, or read of, Cambridge Analytica? This group used facebook in order to gain votes for the US elections for Donald Trump. If they can do this, who knows how many other groups or people out there can have access to your webcam, to your data and to everything you digitally own online. Blockout is one step forward in trying to help protect and prevent creepy spies watching you without your consent or knowledge.</p>
			</div>

				<div class="g-70 padded">
							<h3>Functionality & Purpose</h3>
							<p>The function of this gadget is to block out the spies that watch us through our laptop cameras. I have seen plenty of university students who have sticky tape covering their cameras which led to this idea of having something to replace the sticky tape. The puropose is simple and has been mentioned- it is to block out those sneaky hacker spies who enjoy creepily watching you without your knowledge.</p>

					<h3>What This Product Can Do For You.</h3>
					<p>This product provides its customers with a safe reassurance that no more spies can see them through their webcams. The idea of someone spying on you through your webcams is absolutely horrifying and creating something like this can stop that fear of "government spies" as some may believe.<p>
				</div>

			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>What Inspired This Product.</h3>
				<p>This gadget was inspired by a sliding door and a sim card/sim card tray. I thought about a sliding motion and how a small gadget like this could slide to reveal and hide the camera on someone's laptop.<p>

				<h3>The Meaning of 'Blockout'.</h3>
				<p><strong>Blockout</strong> came from the term 'Blackout', essentially meaning to 'Blockout' the spies watching us through our laptop cameras.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>What Devices Can This Product Be Used On.</h3> <!---Make this a list--->
				<p>This gadget is to be made to fit onto all laptop brands, however, to do that it will have to be adjustable to fit any laptop. I have a windows microsoft surface laptop and a 2009 macbook pro so the dimensions and size of this gadget will be based off of these.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Laptops</li>
					<li>Tablets</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Packaging and Material.</h3>
			<p>The packaging for this product is simple and easy to use as well as sustainable as it is not plastic. Using MDF wood, this box (inspired by Brand Power USB website), enables you (the user) to place your product in there then attach it to your keychain so it won't get lost.</p>

			<h2><a href="http://www.brandedusbpower.com">Inspired by website Branded USB Power</a></h2>
			<p>The material of both the packaging and the product are wood. We don't want to use plastic and unsustainable material so wood is a good way to go. Below is an image form Amazon of the type of MDF wood that is used.</p>

			<h3>Shipping & Costs.</h3>
			<p>DID I MENTION THAT YOU CAN ORDER THIS PRODUCT <strong>FOR FREE</strong>?! However, of course, shipping will have a cost depending on where you are located. The reasons for the product being free is so that you don't have to pay for this to prevent spies, you can simply order for free and enjoy the function of the product.</p>
