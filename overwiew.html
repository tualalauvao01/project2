	 <strong>Brief</strong>
			<p>The brief of this project was to come up with an idea that interests us. I thought about how useful it would be to have a gadget, product of some sort, that would essentially 'Blockout' the supposed "spies" that are watching us through our laptop cameras. The name of this project is <strong>BLOCKOUT</strong>- like blackout, except it’s with an ‘O’. At university, I have seen numerous students with sticky tape covering their laptop cameras. Now, I introduce this new detachable gadget that can attach to the top of your laptop and slide left-to-right to hide and reveal your camera. The reason for having the option to reveal your camera is for those who take video calls, whether that be business or family. This makes it easier for the user as they don't have to rip off a piece of sticky tape and put it back on after it has lost its "stickiness".</p>
<strong>Inspiration</strong>
<p>The actual design of this blockout gadget was inspired by the shape of a sim card and a sim card tray. At the front it has a cut-out which is what drove me to design something like this. The material of this gadget would probably be wood-thin, easy mdf wood as it is easy to cut/saw. The colour of the gadget will most likely be basic wood, or black painted on it. These are thoughts about the actual gadget if I were to make it.</p>
<strong>Target Audience and How to target them</strong>
<p>The chosen target audience for this product are university students because the majority of those I see covering their cameras are students. Also, because I am doing an online publication, there will also be a target audience of internet users which is very wide and broad audience. In order to target these audiences I think that style and colour of the product and my website will appeal to them, as well as functionality- Does it serve its purpose of "blocking out" spies?, Does it fit on all laptops?, Is it stable?</p>
<strong>Tone</strong>
<p>I'll be creating a logo for the gadget. There will be a colour palette and chosen fonts for heading and body. The logo will be something I create with adobe illustrator and I will go through small iterations in coming up with a final logo.</p>

<p>Overall, the idea of this gadget to hide the camera from spies watching us is quite simple but my aim with my website is to make it interactive, include drawings, maybe some photography and create a layout that would target my specific audiences.
